# How to use regular expressions and extract all email addresses from a text file.

# Basics of Regular expression

**Example : ** Regular expression for an email address :
^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$


The above regular expression can be used for checking if a given set of characters is an email address or not.

**How to write regular expression?**

-   **Repeaters : * , + and { } :**  
    These symbols act as repeaters and tell the computer that the preceding character is to be used for more than just one time.
-   **The asterisk symbol ( * ):**  
    It tells the computer to match the preceding character (or set of characters) for 0 or more times (upto infinite).
    
    **Example :** The regular expression ab*c will give ac, abc, abbc, 
    abbbc….ans so on 
    
-   **The Plus symbol ( + ):**  
    It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) for atleast one or more times(upto infinite).
    
    **Example :** The regular expression ab+c will give abc, abbc,
    abbc, … and so on.
    
-   **The curly braces {…}:**  
    It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) for as many times as the value inside this bracket.
    
    **Example :** {2} means that the preceding character is to be repeated 2 
    times, {min,} means the preceding character is matches min or  more 
    times. {min,max} means that the preceding character is repeated at
    least min & at most max times.
    
-   **Wildcard – ( . )**  
    The dot symbol can take place of any other symbol, that is why it  
    is called the wildcard character.
    
    **Example :** 
    The Regular expression .* will tell the computer that any character
    can be used any number of times.
    
-   **Optional character – ( ? )**  
    This symbol tells the computer that the preceding character may  
    or may not be present in the string to be matched.
    
    **Example :** 
    We may write the format for document file as – “docx?”
    The ‘?’ tells the computer that x may or may not be 
    present in the name of file format.
    
-   **The caret ( ^ ) symbol:**  _Setting position for match :_tells the computer that the match must start at the beginning of the string or line.
    
    **Example :** ^\d{3} will match with patterns like "901" in "901-333-".
    
-   **The dollar ( $ ) symbol**  
    It tells the computer that the match must occur at the end of the string or before \n at the end of the line or string.
    
    **Example :** -\d{3}$  will match with patterns like "-333" in "-901-333".
    
-   **Character Classes**  
    A character class matches any one of a set of characters. It is used to match the most basic element of a language like a letter, a digit, space, a symbol etc.
    
    **/s**  : matches any whitespace characters such as space and tab  
    **/S**  : matches any non-whitespace characters  
    **/d**  : matches any digit character  
    **/D**  : matches any non-digit characters  
    **/w**  : matches any word character (basically alpha-numeric)  
    **/W**  : matches any non-word character  
    **/b**  : matches any word boundary (this would include spaces, dashes, commas, semi-colons, etc)

-   **[set_of_characters]**  – Matches any single character in set_of_characters. By default, the match is case-sensitive.
    
    **Example :** [abc] will match characters a,b and c in any string.
    
    **[^set_of_characters] –**  _Negation:_  Matches any single character that is not in set_of_characters. By default, the match is case sensitive.
    
    **Example :** [^abc] will match any character except a,b,c .
    
    **[first-last]**  –  _Character range:_  Matches any single character in the range from first to last.
    
    **Example :** [a-zA-z] will match any character from a to z or A to Z.
    
-   **The Escape Symbol : \**
    
    If you want to match for the actual ‘+’, ‘.’ etc characters, add a backslash( \ ) before that character. This will tell the computer to treat the following character as a search character and consider it for matching pattern.
    
    **Example :** \d+[\+-x\*]\d+ will match patterns like "2+2"
    and "3*9" in "(2+2) * 3*9".
    
-   **Grouping Characters ( )**
    
    A set of different symbols of a regular expression can be grouped together to act as a single unit and behave as a block, for this, you need to wrap the regular expression in the parenthesis( ).
    
    **Example :** ([A-Z]\w+) contains two different elements of the regular 
    expression combined together. This expression will match any pattern 
    containing uppercase letter followed by any character.
    
-   **Vertical Bar ( | ) :**  
    Matches any one element separated by the vertical bar (|) character.
    
    **Example :**  th(e|is|at) will match words - the, this and that.
    
-   **\number :**  
    _Backreference:_  allows a previously matched sub-expression(expression captured or enclosed within circular brackets ) to be identified subsequently in the same regular expression. \n means that group enclosed within the n-th bracket will be repeated at current position.
    
    **Example :** ([a-z])\1 will match “ee” in Geek because the character 
    at second position is same as character at position 1 of the match.
    
-   **Comment : (?# comment) –**  
    Inline comment: The comment ends at the first closing parenthesis.
    
    **Example :** \bA(?#This is an inline comment)\w+\b
    
    **# [to end of line] :**  _X-mode comment._  The comment starts at an unescaped # and continues to the end of the line.
    
    **Example :**  (?x)\bA\w+\b#Matches words starting with A



# Code

   

    # Python program to extract emails From text
    # the String By Regular Expression. 
      
    # Importing module required for regular 
    # expressions 
    import re  
    
    s =  open("test.txt",'r',encoding = 'utf-8')
    
    
    contents = s.read()
    
    # \S matches any non-whitespace character 
    # @ for as in the Email 
    # + for Repeats a character one or more times 
    lst = re.findall('[^,;\s]+@[^,;\s]+', contents)     
      
    # Printing of List 
    print(lst)
